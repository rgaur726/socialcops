                    <p>I am a third year student from BITS Pilani. I have been programming from the age of 12. I have a keen interest in data science. I enjoy applying coding technlogies to the ever increasing data around us.</p><p> In the following project, I have picked data from various sources. For some of the projects, Anaconda was used. Spyder and Jupyter were used for making the plots. Implementation was done in Python. I have used various libraries like Plotly, basemap, numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc. The data sources range <u><a href="www.data.gov.in">www.data.gov.in</a></u> to Berkeley Earth to <a href=www.cricbuzz.com><u>www.cricbuzz.com</u></a>.</p> <p>Lastly I would like to apologise if my code is hard to read and understand because I have my academics going on here in BITS and with the time constraint of just 8 days, I was unable to comment my code. </p>

                    <p>Another comparasion study was done here for five years from 2008 to 2012. The top sources of energy present to us are Coal, natural gas, petroleum and renewable energy. How much of these are consumed per year is the major factor in deciding the economy of India since Fuel is a necessity. The results clearly proved that India is distinctily dependent on Coal for most of its energy needs. Maybe this is a sign that we really need to develop and find newer technologies for generation of power since we all know, Fuel is <b>LIMITED</b>.</p>

Another peak was observed near 9.30 to 10 A.M. in the morning showing that people do have a tendency to order stuff as soon as they reach their place of work. </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>India is moving forward. We are getting literate, we are becoming more advanced, we are highly improving in the health sector. But as every coin has two sides, same goes with our homeland. We are loosing our environmental stability. In the aim of achieving more, in the pursue of gaining higher levels, we have exploited our resources. The modernisation of various cities has lead to a huge amount of deforestation, the amount of vehicles has led to a gradual increase in the average temperatue of this country. <br> Some of the studies spoke in themselves, like Whatsapp emerging as the major source of communication for our country in the past few years. Indians shop the most either in the evening or right in the morning. <h3>
                    <h3>In my study, I have tried to cover as many different sections or fields as possible. Some of the data, like the FDI one, or the messenger app one, I searched it manualy and compiled it myself in csv files. I could have written much better code if I wouldnt have been bound by the time constraint. With the classes going on, doing 10 different questions in 8 days was a challenging task. If there is any thing which is making no sense, I am more than happy to explain. <br><u><b>Hopefully, I would have met your expectations </u></b></h3>
